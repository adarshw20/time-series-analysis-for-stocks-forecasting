## Models

### ARIMA
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model for non-seasonal time series forecasting.

### SARIMA
Seasonal ARIMA extends ARIMA to handle seasonal patterns in the data.

### Prophet
Facebook's forecasting tool designed for business time series with strong seasonal effects.

### LSTM
Deep learning approach using Long Short-Term Memory neural networks for sequence prediction.

## Metrics

The application evaluates model performance using:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- **RÂ²** (Coefficient of Determination)

## Technical Analysis

- **Moving Averages**: 10, 20, and 50-day moving averages
- **RSI**: Relative Strength Index for momentum analysis
- **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility bands around moving average

## Data Source

Stock data is fetched from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library, providing:
- Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- Real-time stock information
- Company fundamentals
